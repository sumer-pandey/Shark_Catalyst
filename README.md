## 🧠 Data & Methodology

**Primary Dataset:** [Kaggle – Shark Tank India by Thirumani](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thirumani/shark-tank-india)  

**Analytical Framework Highlights**
- Minimum sample size: **n > 30**
- Statistical significance threshold: **p < 0.05**
- Effect size measured via **Cohen’s d**
- **Propensity score matching** for controlled comparisons
- **Bonferroni correction** for multiple hypothesis testing

All results in the **Evidence-Based Myth Analysis** section are powered by SQL scripts inside `/sql/sql/`, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

## 🧾 Example Myths Tested

- Startups with patents are funded at a higher rate  
- Startups with >20 SKUs are funded less often  
- Bootstrapped startups are funded more often  
- Deals with royalties close less often than equity-only deals  
- Investors tend to concentrate >50% of their capital in specific sectors  
- Average ticket size has increased over successive seasons  

Each myth includes:
- Methodology (SQL logic)
- Statistical test applied  
- Verdict and confidence level  
- Effect size or rate differential
